# WEB SITE ANALYZER

## About The Project

Web Site Analyzer is a powerful tool designed to identify and resolve issues during the web development process. By leveraging the Playwright's Axe Builder, it detects accessibility problems on websites, while integrating the Google PageSpeed Insights API to analyze and address performance, accessibility, SEO, and other critical aspects. The tool also includes Whois API integration, providing real-time information about a website's domain and its owner.

In addition to these features, users can benefit from AI-powered support to help them solve issues. Whether it's fixing technical flaws or improving overall web performance, the Web Site Analyzer assists users with actionable insights and automated solutions to optimize their sites effectively. The development of the tool is ongoing, with continuous updates aimed at enhancing its functionality and offering a comprehensive web analysis experience.

This project empowers developers, designers, and website owners to streamline their optimization process, ensuring their websites are not only accessible and high-performing but also compliant with the latest best practices in web development.
